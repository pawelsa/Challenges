int main(){

// 1	Prime factorization(or prime decomposition).For a given positive integer, express it as a product of prime numbers.





// 2	Dec2Bin.Write a program reading a decimal integer, converting it to binary and writing the result.
// 3	Write a function reversing the binary representation of an integer.For example, binreverse(200) = 19, because 20010 = 110010002 and 1910 = 100112.
// 4	Write a function accepting a text string(a pointer to char) and counting words in this text.
// 5	Write a function computing the day of week for a given date.
// 6	Write a function computing the number of days between January the 1st, 2000 and the given date.
// 7	Find such a 4 - digit number n, that the last 4 digits of n*n are equal n.
// 8	Write a program multiplying two big integers given as text strings.
// 9	Write a program converting a text into Morse code.Use a dot, dash and a space as output symbols.
// 10	Write a program converting Morse code into plain text.Use symbols from the previous task.
// 11	Write a program finding the longest palindrome(like "hannah") in a given text.
// 12	Write a program converting a given decimal number into a Roman number.
// 13	Write a program converting a Roman number into a decimal number.
// 14	Arrange digits 1 to 9 in form of a fraction equal to 1 / 3 (e.g. 6342 / 91785).
